## 4. Database Design Overview 🗃️
**Key Entities:**
- **User** 👤: Represents Airbnb users (guests or hosts).
- **Booking** 📅: Stores booking details like user, property, and dates.
- **Property** 🏡: Contains listing details (e.g., location, pricing).
- **Review** ⭐: Captures user reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Payment** 💳: Records payment details for bookings.

**Relationships:**
- **User ↔ Booking**: One-to-Many. A user can have multiple bookings, but each booking is linked to one user.
- **Property ↔ Booking**: One-to-Many. A property can have multiple bookings, but each booking corresponds to one property.
- **Property ↔ Review**: One-to-Many. A property can have multiple reviews, but each review is tied to one property.

---

## 5. Feature Breakdown ✨
- **Complex Joins** 🔗: Implements INNER, LEFT, and FULL OUTER JOINs to retrieve interconnected data (e.g., bookings with user or property details), enabling robust data analysis.
- **Subqueries** 🧩: Uses correlated and non-correlated subqueries to filter data, like finding high-rated properties or frequent bookers, enhancing analytical depth.
- **Aggregations & Window Functions** 📊: Employs COUNT, SUM, ROW_NUMBER, and RANK to analyze booking trends and rank properties, providing actionable insights.
- **Indexing** ⚡: Creates indexes on frequently queried columns to boost query performance, optimizing large dataset handling.
- **Query Optimization** 🚀: Refactors complex queries to reduce execution time by leveraging indexing and eliminating redundancies.
- **Table Partitioning** 📂: Partitions the Booking table by date range to improve query performance on large datasets, addressing scalability.
- **Performance Monitoring** 🔍: Uses EXPLAIN, ANALYZE, and SHOW PROFILE to monitor and refine query performance, ensuring long-term efficiency.

## 6. API Security Overview 🔒
- **Authentication** 🛡️: Restricts database access to authorized users, protecting sensitive data like user and payment details.
- **Input Validation** ✅: Validates SQL inputs to prevent injection attacks, ensuring database integrity.
- **Rate Limiting** ⏱️: Caps query execution rates to prevent database overload, maintaining performance under high traffic.
- **Data Encryption** 🔐: Encrypts sensitive data (e.g., payments) in transit and at rest, ensuring confidentiality and compliance.

---

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Overview 🚀
The project leverages a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to streamline SQL script development and deployment. Using GitHub Actions (inferred), the pipeline automates syntax validation, performance checks, and peer reviews. This ensures error-free, optimized scripts and supports collaborative development for scalable database solutions. 🛠️
