## 1. Project Overview 🌟
**Brief Description:**
<p> DataScape is a relational database design project for an Airbnb-like application, enabling users to sign up as hosts, guests, or admins, list properties, book accommodations, submit reviews, process payments, and exchange messages.</p>
<p> Part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module, it delivers a scalable, 3NF-normalized database with a robust schema, optimized for data integrity and performance in a production-level environment.</p>

**Project Goals:**
- 🛠️ Design a comprehensive database schema to support user management, property listings, bookings, review, payments, and messaging.
- 📊 Normalize to 3NF to ensure data integrity and eliminate redundancy.
-  ⚡ Optimize query performance with UUID-based primary keys, indexes, and constraints.
- 📈 Seed the database with realistic sample data to simulate Airbnb-like functionality.
- 📝 Document the design process and adhere to professional repository standards.

**Key Tech Stack:**
<p>SQL (MySQL), eraser for ER diagrams, Git/GitHub for version control.</p>
